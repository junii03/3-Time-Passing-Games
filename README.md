# 3-Time-Passing-Games
This contains three small guessing games to kill some extra time.
a program that displays the following menu: guessing games.
1. Play Higher or Lower
2. Play paper, scissors and rock
3. Guess the numbers
4. Quit

If the user enters 1, the program generates two random numbers between 1 and 20 and 
displays the first number. It then asks the user to enter either H or L for higher or lower.
The user wins if they entered and the second number was higher than the first or when they 
entered L, and the second number was lower.

If the user enters 2, the program generates one random number between 1 and 3, with 1
corresponding to paper, 2 to scissors, and 3 to rock. Then it asks the user to
Enter P for paper, S for scissors, or R for rock. The program then displays who won the
computer or the user.
Rule: Scissors beat paper, rock beats scissors, and paper beats rock.

Finally, if the user enters 3, the program generates three random numbers, each between 0 and 
9. The user should guess three numbers and the program compares each of the user's 
guesses to the three generated random numbers and displays an appropriate output based on 
whether they got:
a. Anyone matching
b. Two matching
c. Three matchings, not in order
d. Three matching in exact order
e. Or no matches at all
